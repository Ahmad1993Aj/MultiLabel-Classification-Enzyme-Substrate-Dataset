# Kaggle Competition: Playground Series - S3E18

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition "Playground Series - S3E18". The competition aims to develop a predictive model to accurately predict a target variable based on provided features.

## Competition Description

The competition dataset consists of a set of features and a target variable. The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately predicts the target variable using the given features. Participants are encouraged to perform data analysis, handle missing values, and explore the dataset using popular Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and plotly.

## Solution Approach

In this solution, I leveraged the power of XGBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm known for its high performance in machine learning competitions. I conducted extensive data analysis using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib and plotly for visualization. The missing values were handled using appropriate techniques. 

The XGBoost model was fine-tuned by optimizing hyperparameters to achieve the best possible performance. Cross-validation techniques were employed to evaluate the model's performance, and the final predictions were made on the test dataset.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the competition dataset (not included in the repository)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training
- `submission/`: Final submission file in CSV format

## Getting Started

To reproduce the results:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the competition dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e18) and place it in the `data/` directory.
3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks or run the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory.

## Results

The final model achieved a competitive performance with a high accuracy score on the competition evaluation metric. The submission file can be found in the `submission/` directory.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Kaggle for hosting this competition and providing the dataset. Special thanks to the community for sharing valuable insights and knowledge.
